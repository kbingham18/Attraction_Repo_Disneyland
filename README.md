This is a project I created that allows user to view and leave reviews about the attractions in Disneyland. Normal users will have the ability to view attraction information as well as create their own accounts so they can leave reviews about their own experiences. The application also allows for admin users to manage attraction information. Admin users can add, edit and delete attractions. They also have the option to remove reviews. This application was created using python, html, and Django.
